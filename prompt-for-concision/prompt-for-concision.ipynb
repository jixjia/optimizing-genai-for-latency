This success was mirrored in its global sales, especially in the European and Asian markets, which sold 1.8 and 2.0 million units respectively. There was promising growth in the Latin American and African markets, despite lower sales numbers (0.5 and 0.3 million units respectively).\\n\\nUser feedback overall was a mixture of praise and critique. The game's mechanics and strategic elements received commendation, but the micro-transaction system, which involves the use of real money to buy in-game currency and expedite progress, was criticised for making the game too expensive and providing an unfair advantage to players who spend more.\\n\\nThe game's impressive sales figures underscore its appeal and quality, but user feedback points to an urgent need to improve the micro-transaction system. The company's future plan is to re-evaluate this system, making it transparent and fair while not disadvantaging those who choose not to spend extra. Additionally, they plan to alter their marketing strategies to better penetrate the less successful markets. Despite criticisms, the company is confident of continued success with these improvements.\""
